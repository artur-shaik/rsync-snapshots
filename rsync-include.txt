# rsync include list.
# note:
#  -be careful with trailing spaces, '- * ' is different from '- *'
#  -rsync stops at first matched rule and ignore the rest
#  -rsync descends iteratively the folders-arborescence
#  -'**' matches also zero, one or several '/'
#  -get the list of all root files/folders
#     pdsh -f 1 -w server[1-22] 'ls -la / | sed -e "s/  */ /g" | cut -d" " -f9-' | cut -d" " -f2- | sort -u
#  -include all folders with '+ */' (missing this rule implies that '- *' will override all the inclusions of any subfolders)
#  -exclude all non explicited files with '- *'
#  -exclude everything except /etc/ssh: '+ /etc/ssh/** \ + */ \ - *'
#  -exclude content of /tmp but include foldername: '- /tmp/* \ + */'
#  -exclude content and also foldername /tmp: '- /tmp/ \ + */'
#  -exclude content of each .ssh but include foldername: '- /**/.ssh/* \ + */'
#
# include everything except /tmp/:
#- /tmp/
# same but include /tmp/ as an empty folder:
